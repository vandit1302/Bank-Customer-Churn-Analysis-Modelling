# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Modelling

This repo contains the notebooks which contain the entire EDA, Machine Learning models, and Deep Learning models used on the Bank Customer Churn Dataset

Dataset: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers)

## :computer: Methodologies used:

* Extensive EDA using python libraries
* In depth Data Visualization using seaborn and ggplot libraries in Python
* Machine Learning models - Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, GNB
* Ensemble Models - XGBoost, LGBM, AdaBoost
* Deep Learning models - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm implementation to optimize accuracy of ANN and Logistic Regression models
